Event Details
Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.



Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.


Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.


You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.


Rules
      To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).
      PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in         line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
       This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.

Quality Standards
               In line with Hacktoberfest values (Quantity is fun, quality is key) , here you are provided examples of pull requests that we consider to be low-quality       contributions (which we discourage).

               Pull requests that are automated (e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace/fix typos/optimize images).

               Pull requests that are disruptive (e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request).

               Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

               Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

               Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
